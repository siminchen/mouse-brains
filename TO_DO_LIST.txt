HIGH LEVEL GOALS
-Finish data generation
-Finish literature review
-Gain the faintest clue about how to run the models
-Run the models

DATA GENERATION
Rerun Microglia (sample2) mapping (tophat->cufflinks)
Merge transcripts into one file (cuffmerge)
"Normalize" (a.k.a. put them into a reasonable format - cuffquant->cuffnorm)

DATA QC
Removing minimally expressed values
Project data to standard distribution?
